================================ Questions ==================================

1. Padding design: If we restrict the size of the Gaussian kernels to odd 
integers between 3 and 11 inclusive, and we only allow 256x256 pixel images, 
what is the size of the largest padded image needed to handle padding with 
any kernel size? At what index will the upper-left pixel of the original 
image be placed in the padded image (answer in terms of N, the kernel size)? 
At what index in the padded array will the lower-right pixel of the original 
image be placed?

:

2. Kernel Design: Manually compute the raw and normalized Gaussian kernels 
for N=3, sigma=2. Use 4 decimal places. Discuss what would happen to the 
image if we used the raw kernel values.

:

3. Experimenation:  Provide the results for ALL experiments listed in the
                    writeup.

:

4. Express in mathematical terms how the number of calculations your 
 program performs grows with the size, N, of the kernel.
